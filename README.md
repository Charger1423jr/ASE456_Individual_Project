# Bookeep

## Goals

Produce a high quality multi-platform application that will track books you have read and store them in a list for you to review

## What is the problem to solve?

A better way for me and my friends to track our reading competition so each individual has a page they can find all their statistics and points.

## Why this problem is important to solve?

Currently, we are using text chat to store these. The information is hard to follow and track, making it possible for someone to have the wrong information, or cheat.

## How do I solve this problem?

Using the application, the user will enter their book title, word count, and a rating. This will be stored on the home page, and a calculation will take the total word counts of all registered books and generate a number of points they have accumulated.
